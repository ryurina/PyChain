## What's a Cryptocurrency ?

## Where are the Coins ?
Coins are transferred with **transactions**
Changing them into other currencies is not possible inside the Blockchain
=> The value of a coin is determined by the value the participants of the blockchain network assign to it (i.e. what you're willing to pay in "real" currencies).
Coins are created via **Mining** (as a reward for the effort)
